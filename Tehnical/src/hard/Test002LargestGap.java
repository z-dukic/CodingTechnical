	 * Given an array of integers, return the largest gap between the sorted elements
	 * of the array.
	 * 
	 * For example, consider the array:
	 * 
	 * [9, 4, 26, 26, 0, 0, 5, 20, 6, 25, 5] ... in which, after sorting, the array
	 * becomes:
	 * 
	 * [0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9, 20, 25, 26, 26] ... so that we now see that the largest
	 * gap in the array is between 9 and 20 which is 11.
